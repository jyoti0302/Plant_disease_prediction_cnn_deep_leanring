# Plant_disease_prediction

This project detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Key steps include:

🖼️ Loaded and visualized sample plant disease images.

🧠 Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.

🏋️‍♀️ Trained the model to classify plant diseases.

🧪 Evaluated model performance by comparing test and validation data accuracy.

🔮 Implemented a function to predict diseases from new images.
